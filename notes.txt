Learning Rust Programming Language:
----------------------------------
- Notes that accompany following this tutorial
    - https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book
- println is implemented as a macro in rust
    - macros are called like functions with a ! after the name
    - why this is implemented as a macro is an advanced topic
    - Rust macros are different from C macros
        - used for meta-programming
- Cargo
    - build system and depedency management
    - make a src folder
    - Note that since we're creating an executable, we used
      main.rs. If we want to make a library instead, we should use lib.rs 
    - cargo build
        - ./target/debug/hello_world
    - cargo run
    - cargo build --release
        - build with optimizations
        - adds new file: Cargo.lock
            - for depedency tracking
